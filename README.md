# Celestial Bodies Database

### Objective

Build a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL

### Directions To Run

1. Clone the directory
2. `cd` into the project directory
3. Run `psql -U postgres < universe.sql` in the terminal

Note: You may need to have a PostgreSQL database set up locally named postgres, if you set a database up under a different name change the command to include your db name instead `psql -U (your db name here) < universe.sql`

### Tasks

- You should create a database named universe

- Be sure to connect to your database with \c universe. Then, you should add tables named galaxy, star, planet, and moon

- Each table should have a primary key

- Each primary key should automatically increment

- Each table should have a name column

- You should use the INT data type for at least two columns that are not a primary or foreign key

- You should use the NUMERIC data type at least once

- You should use the TEXT data type at least once

- You should use the BOOLEAN data type on at least two columns

- Each "star" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in galaxy

- Each "planet" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in star

- Each "moon" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in planet

- Your database should have at least five tables

- Each table should have at least three rows

- The galaxy and star tables should each have at least six rows

- The planet table should have at least 12 rows

- The moon table should have at least 20 rows

- Each table should have at least three columns

- The galaxy, star, planet, and moon tables should each have at least five columns

- At least two columns per table should not accept NULL values

- At least one column from each table should be required to be UNIQUE

- All columns named name should be of type VARCHAR

- Each primary key column should follow the naming convention table_name_id. For example, the moon table should have a primary key column named moon_id

- Each foreign key column should have the same name as the column it is referencing
